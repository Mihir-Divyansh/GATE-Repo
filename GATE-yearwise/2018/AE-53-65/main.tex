%\begin{enumerate}
	\item A pilot probe on an aircraft in a steady level flight records a pressure of $55,000 N/m^2$. The static pressure and density are $45,280 N/m^2$ and $0.6 kg/m^2$ respectively.The wing area and the lift coefficient are $16 m^2$ and 0.2 respectively, then the wing loading on this aircraft is
	\item A spacecraft forms a circular orbit at an altitude of 150 km above the surface of Earth. Assuming the gravitational parameter, $\mu = 3.986 \times 10^{14} m^3/s^2$ radius of Earth = 6400 km, the velocity required for the injection of the spacecraft, parallel to the local horizom is
	\item Air at 50 kPa pressure and 400 K temperature, flows in a duct in Mach 3.0 A part of the flow leaks through a duct wall into the ambient, where the pressure is 30 kPa. The maximum Mach number achieved in the discharge is ( assume $\gamma = 1.4$ )
	\item Consider a $20 \degree$ half-angle flow in a supersonic Mach 3.0 at a standard sea-level conditions. If the shock-wave angle on the wedge is $36 \degree$, the Mach number of tangential flow-post shock is
	\item The boundary layer thickness at a location of a sensor on a flat plate, in a incompressible laminar flow of water is required to be restricted to 1 mm for an effectiv measurement. if the flow velcity is $20 m/s$ with 1 bar pressure and 300 K temperature, and $1.789 \times 10^{-5} kg/(m-s)$, the maximum distance, in mm, from the sensor location to the leading edge is
	\item Gross weight of an airplane is 7000 N, wing area is $16 m^2$ and maximum lift co-efficient is 2.0 Assuming density at the altitude to be $1.23 kgm/s^2$, the stall speed of the aircraft is
	\item A thin-walled tube with an external radius 100 mm and thickness 2 mm, is fixed at one end. It is subjected to a force of 1N parallel to its length, the maximum normal stress experienced by the structure is
	\item A 1m long massless cantilever beam oscillates at 2 Hz, while a 60 kg mass it attached to the tip of it. the flexural rigidity in the beam ( in $kN-m^2$ ) is
	\item A cantilever beam of rectangular cross-section of width 60 mm and depth 100 mm is made of aluminium alloy. The material mechanical properties are : \\
	Young's modulus $E = 73 GPa $ \\
	Ultimate stress $\sigma_{u} = 480 MPa $ \\
	Factor of safety = 4 \\
	the maximum bending moment that can be applied on the beam, in $kN/m^2$ is
	\item The components of stress in a plane-stress condition in the absence of bosy-forces is \\
	$$\sigma{xx} = Ax^2; \sigma{yy} = 12x^2 - 6y^2 ; \sigma{xy} = 12xy $$
	The value of $A$ such that the body is under equilibium is
	\item An axial compressor-rotor with $50 \degree$ reaction, operates with an axial velocity of $200 m/s$. The flow angle at the inlet of rotor is $22 \degree$ with reference to the axial direction. If the axial velocity is assumed to be constant throughout the rotor, the magnitude of relative velocity at the rotor exit is
	\item The relative velocity of air leaving a straight radial impeller of a centrifugal compressor, is $100 m/s$. If the impeller speed is $200 m/s$, for a slip-free operation, the absolute value at the impeller exit is
	\item An aircraft wind tunnel model, having a pitch axis mass moment of inertia of $0.014 kg-m^2$ is mounted in such a way that it has pure pitching motion. If the pitching moment(M) with respect to the angle of attack $\brak{\alpha}$ is -$0.504 N-m/rad$, the pitching moment with espect to pitch rate is -$0.0336 N-m/(rad/s)$, the damping ratio of the resulting motion due to initial disturbance in pitch angle is

\item
	An ideal ramjet is flying at an altitude of $10 km$ with a velocity of $1 km/s$. The ambient pressure is $0.25 bar$ and temperature is $225 K$. The exhaust gases from the engine are optimally expanded and leave the nozzle at $900 K$. If the specific heat ration $\brak{\gamma}$ remains constant, the specific thrust developed by the engine is approximately
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $1000 N-s/kg$
			\item $2000 N-s/kg$
			\item $500 N-s/kg$
			\item $4000 N-s/kg$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item
	A combat aircraft engine is equipped with an afterburner followed by a variable area convergent nozzle (operating with the nozzle choked). The exhaust gas temperature is $750 K$ when afterburner is off and $3000 K$ when it is on. When the afterburner is turned on (assuming the total pressure remains the same, the mass of fuel added in the afterburner is negligible i.e., the mass flow rate remains the same, and the specific heat ratio $\brak{\gamma}$ reamins constant), approximately by what factor must the nozzle area be changed ?
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item 0.5

	\item
	An airplane flying at $100 m/s$ is pitching at the rate of $0.2 deg/s$. Due to this pitching, the horizontal tail surface located 4 metres behind the centre-of-mass of the airplane will experience a change in angle of attack, which is
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $0.01 \degree$
			\item $0.008 \degree$
			\item $0.04 \degree$
			\item $0.004 \degree$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item 
	The contribution of the horizontal tail to the pitching moment coefficient about the center of gravity $\brak{C_{m_{CG}}}$ of an aircraft is given by $C_{m_{tail}} = 0.2 - 0.0215\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle of attack of the aircraft. The contribution of the tail to the aircraft longitudinal stability

			\item is stabilizing
			\item is destabilizing
			\item is nil
			\item cannot be determined from the given information

	\item
	The linearized dynamics of an aircraft (which has no large rotating components) in straight and level flight is governed by the equations
	\begin{align}
		\frac{d\vec{\bar{x}}}{dt} &= \myvec{\sbrak{A} & \sbrak{B} \\ \sbrak{C} & \sbrak{D}}
	\end{align}
	where $\vec{\bar{x}} = \myvec{u & w & q & \theta & v & p & r & \psi}^{T}$, $\myvec{{}}^{T}$ represents the transpose of a matrix, $\sbrak{A}$, $\sbrak{B}$, $\sbrak{C}$ and $\sbrak{D}$ are $4 \times 4$ matrices and $\sbrak{0}$ is the $4 \times 4$ null matrix. Which of the following is true?

			\item $\sbrak{A} = \sbrak{0}$; $\sbrak{B} \neq \sbrak{0}; \sbrak{C} \neq \sbrak{0}; \sbrak{D} = \sbrak{0}$
			\item $\sbrak{A} \neq \sbrak{0}$; $\sbrak{B} = \sbrak{0}; \sbrak{C} = \sbrak{0}; \sbrak{D} \neq \sbrak{0}$
			\item $\sbrak{A} \neq \sbrak{0}$; $\sbrak{B} = \sbrak{0}; \sbrak{C} \neq \sbrak{0}; \sbrak{D} = \sbrak{0}$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item
	The velocity vector of an aircraft along its body-fixed axis is given by $\vec{\bar{V}} = \myvec{u \\ v \\ w}$. If $V$ is the magnitude of $\vec{\bar{V}}$, $\alpha$ is the angle of attack and $\beta$ is the angle of sideslip, which of the following set of relations is correct?
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $u = V\sin{\beta}\cos{\alpha}; v = V\sin{\beta}; w = V\cos{\beta}\sin{\alpha}$
			\item $u = V\cos{\beta}\cos{\alpha}; v = V\cos{\beta}; w = V\cos{\beta}\sin{\alpha}$
			\item $u = V\cos{\beta}\cos{\alpha}; v = V\sin{\beta}; w = V\sin{\beta}\sin{\alpha}$
			\item $u = V\cos{\beta}\cos{\alpha}; v = V\sin{\beta}; w = V\cos{\beta}\sin{\alpha}$

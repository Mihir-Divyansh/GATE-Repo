\item A massless cantilever beam $PQ$ has a solid square cross section $\brak{10\text{ mm x }10\text{ mm}}$.

\item An aircraft, with a wing loading $\frac{W}{S} = 500$ N/$m^2$, is gliding at $\brak{\frac{L}{D}}_{max} = 10$ and $C_L = 0.69$. Considering the free stream density $\rho_{\infty} = 0.9$ kg/$m^3$, the equilibrium glide speed $\brak{\text{in m/s}}$ is $\rule{2cm}{0.1pt}.$

\item The velocity of an incompressible laminar boundary layer over a flat plate developing under constant pressure is given by $\frac{u\brak{y}}{U_{\infty}} = \frac{3y}{2\delta} - \frac{1}{2}\brak{\frac{y}{\delta}}^3$. The freestream velocity $U_\infty = 10$ m/s and the dynamic viscosity of the fluid $\mu = 1.8$ x $10^{-5}\frac{kg}{ms}$. At a streamwise station where the boundary layer thickness $\delta = 5$ mm, the wall shear stress is $\rule{2cm}{0.1pt}$ x $10^{-3}$ Pa.

\item the Pitot tube of an aircraft registers a pressure $p_0 = 54051 N/m^2$. The static pressure, density and the ratio of specific heats of the freestream are $p_\infty = 45565 N/m^2$, $\rho_\infty = 0.6417 kb/m^3$ and $\gamma = 1.4$, respectively. The indicated airspeed $\brak{\text{in m/s}}$ is

\item Consider a NACA 0012 aerfoil of chord $c$ in a freestream with velocity $V_\infty$ at a non-zero positive angle of attack $\alpha$. The average time-of-flight for a particle to move from the leading edge to the trailing edge on the suction and pressure sides are $t_1$ and $t_2$, respectively. Thin aerfoil theory yields the velocity perturbation to the freestream as $V_\infty\frac{\brak{1 + \cos\theta}\alpha}{\sin\theta}$ on the suction side and as $-V_\infty\frac{\brak{1 + \cos\theta}\alpha}{\sin\theta}$ on the pressure side, where $\theta$ corresponds to the chordwise position $x = \frac{c}{2}\brak{1-\cos\theta}$. Then $t_2 - t_1$ is

\item A solid rocket monitor is designed with a cylindrical end-burning propellent grain of length $1$ m and diameter $32$ cm. The density of the propellent grain is $1750 kg/m^3$. The specific impulse of the motor is $190$ s and the acceleration due to the gravity is $9.8 m/s^2$.

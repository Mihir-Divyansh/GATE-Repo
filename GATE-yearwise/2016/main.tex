\item The following graph represents the installed capacity for cement production $\brak{\text{in tonnes}}$ and the actual production $\brak{\text{in tonnes}}$ of nine cement plants of a cement company. Capacity utilization of a plant is defined as ratio of actual production of cement to installed capacity. A plant with installed capacity of atleast 200 tonnes is called a large plant and a plant with lesser capacity is called a small plant. The difference between total production of large plants and small plants, in tonnes is \underline{\hspace{1cm}}. \hfill{[2016-XE]}\\

\item A poll of students appearing for masters in engineering indicated that $60\%$ of the students believed that mechanical engineering is a profession unsuitable for women. A research study on women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering found that $99 \%$ of such women were successful in their professions.\\

Which of the following can be logically inferred from the above paragraph? 

    \hfill{[2016-XE]}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Many students have misconceptions regarding various engineering disciplines.\\
    \item Men with advanced degrees in mechanical engineering believe women are well suited to be mechanical engineers.\\
    \item Mechanical engineering is a profession well suited for women with masters or higher degrees in mechanical engineering.\\
    \item The number of women pursuing higher degrees in mechanical engineering is small.

\item Sourya committee had proposed the establishment of Sourya Institutes of Technology $\brak{\text{SITs}}$ in line with Indian Institutes of Technology $\brak{\text{IITs}}$ to cater to the technological and industrial needs of a developing country.\\

Which of the following can be logically inferred from the above sentence?\\

Based on the proposal, 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*), leftmargin=3em, labelsep=0.5em, itemindent=1.5em]
    \item In the initial years, SIT students will get degrees from IIT.
    \item SITs will have a distinct national objective.
    \item SIT like institutions can only be established in consultation with IIT.
    \item SITs will serve technological needs of a developing country.

\item A second identical airfoil is placed behind the first one at a distance of $c/2$ from the trailing edge of the first. The second airfoil has an unknown circulation $\Gamma_2$, placed at its quarter chord. The normal velocity becomes zero at the same chord-wise locations of the respective airfoils as in the previous question. The values of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are respectively

\textbf{Statement for Linked Answer Questions Q.54 and Q.55:} A wing-body alone configuration airplane with a wing loading of $\frac{W}{S} = 1000N/m^2$ is flying in cruise condition at a speed $V = 90m/s$ at sea-level (air density at sea-level $\rho_e = 1.122kg/m^3$). The zero lift pitching moment coefficient of the airplane is $C_{\text{m0}} = C_{m_{\text{ac}}} = -0.06$ and the location of airplane aerodynamic center from the wing leading edge is $X_{\text{ac}} = 0.25c$. Here $c$ is the chord length.

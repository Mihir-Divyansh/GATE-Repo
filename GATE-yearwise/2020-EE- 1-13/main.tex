\item Non-performing assets (NPAs) of a bank in India is defined as an asset, which remains unpaid by the borrower for a certain period of time in terms of interest, principal or both. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has changed the definition of NPA thrice during 1993-2004, in terms of the holding period of loans.The holding period was reduced by one quarter each time. In 1993, the holding period was four quarters (360 days). \bigskip
Based on the above paragraph, the holding period of loans in 2004 after the third revision was \underline{\hspace{1cm}} days.

\item When a retaining wall moves away from the backfill, the pressure exerted on the wall is termed as

\begin{enumerate}
	\item passive earth pressure
	\item swelling pressure
	\item pore pressure
	\item active earth pressure
\end{enumerate}

%9
\item Compaction by vibratory roller is the best method of compaction in case of

\item A person standing on the bank of a canal drops a stone on the water surface. He notices that the disturbance on the water surface is not traveling upstream. This is because the flow in the canal is

\begin{enumerate}
	\item sub-critical
	\item super-critical
	\item steady
	\item uniform

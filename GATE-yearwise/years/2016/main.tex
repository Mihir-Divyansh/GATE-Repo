    \item A seepage flow condition is shown in the figure. The saturated unit weight of the soil $\gamma_{sat}=18$ kN/m$^3$. Using unit weight of water, $\gamma_{w} = 9.81$ kN/m$^3$, the effective vertical stress (expressed in kN/m$^2$) on plane $X-X$ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}\\

    \item A drained triaxial compression test on a saturated clay yielded the effective shear strength parameters as $c' = 15$kPa and $\phi' = 22\degree$. Consolidates Undrained triaxial test on an identical sample of this clay at a cell pressure of $200$ kPa developed a pore water pressure of $150$ kPa at failure. The deviator stress (expressed in kPa) at failure is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item A concrete gravity dam section is shown in the figure. Assuming unit weight of water as $10$kN/m$^3$ and unit weght of concrete as $24$kN/m$^3$, the uplift force per unit length of the dam (expressed in kN/m) at PQ is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item Seepage is occuring through a porous media shown in the figure. The hydraulic conductivity values ($k_1, k_2, k_3$) are in m/day.

    The seepage discharge (m$^3$/day per m) through the porous media at section PQ is
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\frac{7}{12}$
        \item $\frac{1}{2}$
        \item $\frac{9}{16}$
        \item $\frac{3}{4}$
    \end{enumerate}

    \item A $4$ m wide rectangular channel, having bed slope of $0.001$ carries a discharge of $16$ m$^3$/s. Considering Manning's roughness coefficient $=0.012$ and $g=10$ m/s$^2$, the category of the channel slope is
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item horizontal
        \item mild
        \item critical
        \item steep
    \end{enumerate}

    \item A sector gate is provided on a spillway as shown in the figure. Assuming $g=10$ m/s$^2$, the resultant force per meter length (expressed in kN/m) on the gate will be \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item A hydraulically efficient trapezoidal channel section has a uniform flow depth of $2$ m. The bed width (expressed in m) of the channel is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item Effluent from an industry 'A' has a pH of $4.2$. The effluent from another industry 'B' has double the hydroxyl (OH$^-$) ion concentration than the effluent from industry 'A'. pH of effluent from the industry 'B' will be \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) with $5600$ m$^2$ of collector plate area is $96$ percent efficient in treating $185$ m$^3$/s of flue gas from a $200$ MW thermal power plant. It was found that in order to achieve $97$ percent efficiency, the collector plate area should be $6100$ m$^2$. In order to increase the efficiency to $99$ percent, the ESP collector plate area (expressed in m$^2$) would be \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item The $2$-day and $4$-day BOD values of a sewage sample are $100$ mg/L and $155$ mg/L, respectively. The value of BOD rate constant (expressed in per day) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item A two lane, one-way road with radius of $50$ m is predominantly carrying lorries with wheelbase of $5$ m. The speed of lorries is restricted to be between $60$ kmph and $80$ kmph. The mechanical widening and psychological widening required at $60$ kmph are designated as $w_{me,60},w_{ps,60},w_{me,80},w_{ps,80}$, respectively are

        \item $0.89$ m, $0.50$ m, $1.19$ m, and $0.50$ m

    \item While traveling along and against the traffic stream, a moving observer measures the relative flows as $50$ vehicles/hr and $200$ vehicles/hr, respectively. The average speeds of the moving observer while traveling along and against the stream are $20$ km/hr and $30$ km/hr, respectively. The density of the traffic stream (expressed in vehicles/km) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

    \item The vertical angles subtended by the top of a tower T at two instrument stations set up at P and Q, are shown in the figure. The two stations are in line with the tower and spaces at a distance of $60$ m. Readings taken from these two stations on a leveling staff placed at the benchmark (BM = $450.000$ m) are also shown in the figure. The reduced level of the top of the tower T (expressed in m) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}

\item Let $X_1$,$X_2$,\dots,$X_n$ $\brak{n\geq2}$ be a random sample from a $N\brak{\theta,\theta}$ population, where $\theta>0$, and let 
\[
W=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2
\]
Then the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$ is
\begin{enumerate}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\item $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1-4W}$
\item $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+4W}$
\item $\frac{-1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1-4W}$
\item $\frac{-1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+4W}$

\item Consider the following transportation problem. The entries inside the cells denote per unit cost of transportation from the origins to the destinations.

The optimal cost of transportation equals \rule{2cm}{0.15mm}
\item Consider the linear programming problem (LPP):
\[
\text{Maximize} \quad kx_1 + 5x_2
\]
\[
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Subject to } x_1 + x_2 &\leq 1,\\
    2x_1 + 3x_2 &\leq 1, \\
    x_1, x_2 &\geq 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
If $x^*=\brak{x^*_1,x^*_2}$ is an optimal solution of the above LPP with $k=2$, then the largest value of $k$ (rounded to 2 decimal places) for which $x^*$ remains optimal equals \rule{2cm}{0.15mm}

\item \"If you are looking for a history of India, or for an account of the rise and fall of the British Raj. or for the reason of the cleaving of the subcontinent into two mutually antagonistic parts and the effects this mutilation will have in the respective sections, and ultimately on Asia, you will not find it in these pages; for though I have spent a lifetime in the country. I lived too near the seat of events, and was too intimately associated with the actors, to get the perspective needed for the impartial recording of these matters.\"\\\\

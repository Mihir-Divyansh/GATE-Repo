	 $[A]$ is a square matrix which is neither symmetric nor skew-symmetric and $[A]^\top$ is its transpose. The sum and difference of these matrices are defined as $[S] = [A] + [A]^\top$ and $[D] = [A] - [A]^\top$, respectively. Which of the following statements is TRUE?

	    The square root of a number $N$ is to be obtained by applying the Newton Raphson iterations to the equation $x^2 - N = 0$. If $i$ denotes the iteration index, the correct iterative scheme will be

	    A $16$ mm thick plate measuring $650 \, \text{mm} \times 420 \, \text{mm}$ is used as a base plate for an ISHB $300$ column subjected to a factored axial compressive load of $2000$ kN. As per IS $456-2000$, the minimum grade of concrete that should be used below the base plate for safely carrying the load is

\item 
	Consider a reinforcing bar embedded in concrete. In a marine environment this bar undergoes uniform corrosion, which leads to the deposition of corrosion products on its surface and an increase in the apparent volume of the bar. This subjects the surrounding concrete to expansive pressure. As a result, corrosion induced cracks appear at the surface of concrete. Which of the following statements is TRUE?

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Corrosion causes circumferential tensile stresses in concrete and the cracks will be parallel to the corroded reinforcing bar.
            \item Corrosion causes radial tensile stresses in concrete and the cracks will be parallel to the corroded reinforcing bar.
            \item Corrosion causes circumferential tensile stresses in concrete and the cracks will be perpendicular to the direction of the corroded reinforcing bar.
